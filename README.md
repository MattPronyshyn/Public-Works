## Blessing of Multiple Causes

The condensed project can be found in the **BMC_Zone_Entries.ipynb** notebook.

This repository demonstrates the “Blessing of Multiple Causes” approach to causal inference in multi‑cause settings. Using a Poisson latent‑factor model and logistic regression, it adjusts for hidden confounders to estimate offensive and defensive contributions on zone‑entry outcomes. The notebook walks through data preparation, model fitting, predictive checks, and interpretation of player‑level effects.
